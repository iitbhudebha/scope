    <h1>Welcome to the Soft & Condensed Matter Process Engineering Lab (SCoPE)</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Soft & Condensed Matter Process Engineering Lab (SCoPE) at the Department of Chemical Engineering & Technology in the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi. We are working on interesting and exciting problems related to chemical engineering using molecular simulation tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use natural and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to model different molecules using hard-to-soft spheres. We create a virtual stage where these molecules dance in a molecular symphony, moving around (MD/MC/DPD/QC) to uncover their evolution with time and space and teach the machines (ML) to learn. The principles of statistical mechanics are used to calculate the properties of the species from their positions and forces to encounter and understand the problems in nano-science and engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      We complement the outcomes with experiments and continuum scale understanding in our Interfacial Science & Engineering (ISE), a multi-department research group.
